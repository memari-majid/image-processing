# Image-Processing Python Libraries Used in Machine Learning
According to IDC, digital data will skyrocket up to 175 zettabytes, and the huge part of this data is images. Data scientists need to (pre) process these images before feeding them into any machine learning models. They have to do the important (and sometimes dirty) work before the fun part begins.  

To process a large amount of data with efficiency and speed without compromising the results data scientists need to use image processing tools for machine learning and deep learning tasks
